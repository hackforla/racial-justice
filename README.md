# Racial Justice
Racial Justice is a Hack for LA project to help end Qualified Immunity (QI) for Law Enforcement in the United States.


## Project context

Qualified Immunity is a judicial doctrine that protects government officials such as police officers, medical board members, mayors, governors, etc. from lawsuits alleging that the official violated a plaintiff's rights, only allowing suits where officials violated a clearly established statutory or constitutional right. The goal of this project is to highlight the lack of accountability caused by QI and help to put an end to it.
